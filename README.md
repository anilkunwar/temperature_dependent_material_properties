1. The viscosity (mu) data (Pa S) for Au and Ti are presented in the table of temperature and viscosity columns.
2. The specific enthalpy (J/kg)  data for Au and Ti are presented in the table of temperature and specific enthalpy (h) columns.
3. The thermal conductivity (W/(m K) ) of Au and Ti are defined as a function of temperature through the user defined functions.
4. The density (kg/m^3 ) of Au and Ti are defined as a function of temperature through the user defined functions.
5. The heat flux from flat top heat source is imported in the finite element model through the user defined function  (filename: LaserHeatSource.F90)
